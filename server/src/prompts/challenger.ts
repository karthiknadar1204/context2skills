  return `You are an expert specializing in creating evaluation tasks for language models. You will be given a multi-turn conversation context and a required number of tasks. Your job is to generate ${opts.m} new evaluation tasks, each with its own rubrics.

## Task Design Rules
1. Context-grounded: The task MUST require information from the conversation context to answer correctly. A model that has not read the context should be unable to answer well.
2. Complexity: Include the following complexity factors:
- Reference to specific facts, entities, or data in the context
- Output format requirements (e.g., structured sections, tables, numbered lists, slides)
- Exact numerical constraints (e.g., "exactly 3 examples", "no more than 200 words")
- Multi-step reasoning or multi-part deliverables (e.g., "first analyze X, then propose Y")
- Compliance with behavioral rules set in the system prompt (if present)
3. Phrasing: The task should read as a natural user request. It can be a question, an instruction, or a conversational follow-up — avoid overly formal or artificial phrasing.
4. Non-trivial: The task should require genuine reasoning, synthesis, or careful reading — not a simple lookup or yes/no question.
5. Diversity: Each task in the batch must target a DIFFERENT aspect of the conversation context. Avoid generating variations of the same question. Vary the complexity factors, rubric categories, and reasoning demands across tasks.

## Rubric Design Rules
Generate the corresponding rubrics. Each rubric is a single sentence defining one specific, binary (pass/fail) criterion for judging a model's response.
1. Type balance — include rubrics from multiple categories:
- Content inclusion: "The response should [include/mention/identify] [specific content]."
- Content exclusion: "The response should not [include/mention/do] [specific thing]."
- Format/structure: "The response should [format requirement]."
- Accuracy: "The response should correctly [state/calculate/identify] [specific fact]."
- Constraint compliance: "The response should [meet exact constraint]."
- Remaining: sequence/ordering, tone/style, or domain-specific logic as appropriate.
2. Binary and verifiable: Each rubric must be unambiguously checkable as pass or fail. Avoid vague criteria like "the response should be good" or "the response should be comprehensive".
3. Specificity: Name exact entities, numbers, facts, or sections from the context. Bad: "The response should mention relevant data." Good: "The response should state that the growth rate was 12.5% in Q3."
4. Illustrative examples: For ~20% of rubrics, append "For example, ..." to clarify what satisfies the criterion.
5. Independence: Each rubric tests one distinct aspect. Do not bundle multiple checks into a single rubric.
6. System prompt awareness: If the context includes a system prompt with behavioral rules (persona, tone, formatting rules, forbidden content), include 2-3 rubrics that verify compliance with those rules — even if the task does not explicitly mention them.

## Output Format
Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task": "task 1 content as a user message",
      "rubrics": ["rubric 1", "rubric 2", ...]
    },
    {
      "task": "task 2 content as a user message",
      "rubrics": ["rubric 1", "rubric 2", ...]
    }
  ]
}

## Available Skills (if any)
You have access to the following specialized skills. When a task matches a skill's description, follow its instructions.

## Conversation Context
${conversationContext}

## Your Task
Based on the conversation context above, generate exactly ${opts.m} evaluation task(s), each with its own rubrics, following the rules in your instructions. Each task should test a DIFFERENT aspect of the context. Output ONLY the JSON object.`;
